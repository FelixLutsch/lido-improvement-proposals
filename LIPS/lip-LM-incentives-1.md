<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged LIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new LIPs. Note that an LIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your LIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `LIP-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

With this LIP, Chorus One is suggesting a first LDO liquidity incentive mechanism. It seeks to get LDO governance tokens into the hands of users of the Lido protocol by distributing LDO tokens to liquidity providers of the stETH/ETH pair on X. We suggest a total of Y LDO tokens to be distributed over Z time frame.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the LIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the LIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->
This LIP will make us of X (synthetix code?) to distribute LDO tokens to LP providers....

## Motivation
<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the LIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the LIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the LIP will address the issue!-->
LDO tokens are used to decide upon the node operators and oracle providers, as well as to govern various system parameters, including e.g. the fee the Lido protocol is charging. To have the Lido DAO governed by those that gain the most value of the Lido protocol - the Lido users - we suggest distributing LDO tokens to liquidity providers for the X pair.

## Specification
<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview
<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the IP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->
This is a high level overview of *how* the LIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.

### Rationale
<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

### Technical Specification
<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Lido Finance currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->
 => synthetix code?

### Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for LIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->
Based on its widespread usage in the decentralized finance space on Ethereum, we suggest using the Synthetix liquidity incentive code.
