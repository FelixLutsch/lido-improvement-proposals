    <h2 id="what-is-an-dip">What is an DIP?</h2>

<p>DIP stands for Depools Improvement Proposal, it has been adapted from the SIP (Synthetix Improvement Proposal). The purpose of this process is to ensure changes to yEarn are transparent and well governed. An DIP is a design document providing information to the yEarn community about a proposed change to the system. The author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.</p>

<h2 id="dip-rationale">DIP Rationale</h2>

<p>We intend DIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions for changes to yEarn. Because they are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.</p>

<p>It is highly recommended that a single DIP contain a single key proposal or new idea. The more focused the DIP, the more successful it is likely to be.</p>

<p>An DIP must meet certain minimum criteria. It must be a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement. The enhancement must represent a net improvement.</p>

<h2 id="dip-work-flow">DIP Work Flow</h2>

<p>Parties involved in the process are the <em>author</em>, the <a href="#Dip-editors"><em>DIP editors</em></a>, and the yEarn community.</p>

<p>:warning: Before you begin, vet your idea, this will save you time. Ask the yEarn community first if an idea is original to avoid wasting time on something that will be rejected based on prior research (searching the Internet does not always do the trick). It also helps to make sure the idea is applicable to the entire community and not just the author. Just because an idea sounds good to the author does not mean it will have the intend effect. The appropriate public forum to gauge interest around your DIP is <a href="https://discord.com/invite/3AGgWxy">the unofficial yEarn Discord</a> or <a href="https://t.me/yearnfinance">the unofficial yEarn Telegram</a>.</p>

<p>Your role as the champion is to write the DIP using the style and format described below, shepherd the discussions in the appropriate forums, and build community consensus around the idea. Following is the process that a successful DIP will move along:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Proposed -&gt; Approved -&gt; Implemented
  ^                     |
  +----&gt; Rejected       +----&gt; Moribund
  |
  +----&gt; Withdrawn
  v
Deferred
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each status change is requested by the DIP author and reviewed by the DIP editors. Use a pull request to update the status. Please include a link to where people should continue discussing your DIP. The DIP editors will process these requests as per the conditions below.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Work in progress (WIP)</strong> – Once the champion has asked the yEarn community whether an idea has any chance of support, they will write a draft DIP as a <a href="https://github.com/iearn-finance/DIPS/pulls">pull request</a>. Consider including an implementation if this will aid people in studying the DIP.</li>
  <li><strong>Proposed</strong> If agreeable, DIP editor will assign the DIP a number (generally the issue or PR number related to the DIP) and merge your pull request. The DIP editor will not unreasonably deny an DIP. Proposed DIPs will be discussed on governance calls and in Discord. If there is a reasonable level of consensus around the change on the governance call the change will be moved to approved. If the change is contentious a vote of token holders may be held to resolve the issue or approval may be delayed until consensus is reached.</li>
  <li><strong>Approved</strong> – This DIP has passed community governance and is now being prioritised for development.</li>
  <li><strong>Implemented</strong> – This DIP has been implemented and deployed to mainnet.</li>
  <li><strong>Rejected</strong> – This DIP has failed to reach community consensus.</li>
  <li><strong>Withdrawn</strong> – This DIP has has been withdrawn by the author(s).</li>
  <li><strong>Deferred</strong> – This DIP is pending another DIP/some other change that should be bundled with it together.</li>
  <li><strong>Moribund</strong> – This DIP has been implemented and is now obsolete and requires no explicit replacement.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-belongs-in-a-successful-dip">What belongs in a successful DIP?</h2>

<p>Each DIP should have the following parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Preamble - RFC 822 style headers containing metadata about the DIP, including the DIP number, a short descriptive title (limited to a maximum of 44 characters), and the author details.</li>
  <li>Simple Summary - “If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.” Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the DIP.</li>
  <li>Abstract - a short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.</li>
  <li>Motivation (*optional) - The motivation is critical for DIPs that want to change yEarn. It should clearly explain why the existing specification is inadequate to address the problem that the DIP solves. DIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.</li>
  <li>Specification - The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.</li>
  <li>Rationale - The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.</li>
  <li>Test Cases - Test cases may be added during the implementation phase but are required before implementation.</li>
  <li>Copyright Waiver - All DIPs must be in the public domain. See the bottom of this DIP for an example copyright waiver.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dip-formats-and-templates">DIP Formats and Templates</h2>

<p>DIPs should be written in <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">markdown</a> format.
Image files should be included in a subdirectory of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assets</code> folder for that DIP as follows: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assets/Dip-X</code> (for Dip <strong>X</strong>). When linking to an image in the DIP, use relative links such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">../assets/Dip-X/image.png</code>.</p>

<h2 id="dip-header-preamble">DIP Header Preamble</h2>

<p>Each DIP must begin with an <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc822.txt">RFC 822</a> style header preamble, preceded and followed by three hyphens (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">---</code>). This header is also termed <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/">“front matter” by Jekyll</a>. The headers must appear in the following order. Headers marked with “*” are optional and are described below. All other headers are required.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> Dip:</code> <DIP number=""> (this is determined by the DIP editor)</DIP></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> title:</code> <DIP title=""></DIP></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> author:</code> &lt;a list of the author’s or authors’ name(s) and/or username(s), or name(s) and email(s). Details are below.&gt;</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> * discussions-to:</code> &lt;a url pointing to the official discussion thread at gov.yearn.finance&gt;</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> status:</code> &lt; WIP</td>
      <td>PROPOSED</td>
      <td>APPROVED</td>
      <td>IMPLEMENTED &gt;</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> created:</code> <date created="" on=""></date></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> * updated:</code> <comma separated="" list="" of="" dates=""></comma></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> * requires:</code> &lt;DIP number(s)&gt;</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> * resolution:</code> &lt;a url pointing to the resolution of this DIP&gt;</p>

<p>Headers that permit lists must separate elements with commas.</p>

<p>Headers requiring dates will always do so in the format of ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd).</p>

<h4 id="author-header"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">author</code> header</h4>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">author</code> header optionally lists the names, email addresses or usernames of the authors/owners of the DIP. Those who prefer anonymity may use a username only, or a first name and a username. The format of the author header value must be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Random J. User &lt;address@dom.ain&gt;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Random J. User (@username)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>if the email address or GitHub username is included, and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Random J. User</p>
</blockquote>

<p>if the email address is not given.</p>

<h4 id="discussions-to-header"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">discussions-to</code> header</h4>

<p>While an DIP is in WIP or Proposed status, a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">discussions-to</code> header will indicate the URL at <a href="https://gov.yearn.finance/">gov.yearn.finance</a> where the DIP is being discussed.</p>

<h4 id="created-header"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">created</code> header</h4>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">created</code> header records the date that the DIP was assigned a number. Both headers should be in yyyy-mm-dd format, e.g. 2001-08-14.</p>

<h4 id="updated-header"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">updated</code> header</h4>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">updated</code> header records the date(s) when the DIP was updated with “substantial” changes. This header is only valid for DIPs of Draft and Active status.</p>

<h4 id="requires-header"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">requires</code> header</h4>

<p>DIPs may have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">requires</code> header, indicating the DIP numbers that this DIP depends on.</p>

<h2 id="auxiliary-files">Auxiliary Files</h2>

<p>DIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams. Such files must be named DIP-XXXX-Y.ext, where “XXXX” is the DIP number, “Y” is a serial number (starting at 1), and “ext” is replaced by the actual file extension (e.g. “png”).</p>

<h2 id="dip-editors">DIP Editors</h2>

<p>The current DIP editors are:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> * Artem K (@banteg)</code></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> * Cooper Turley (@Cooopahtroopa)</code></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> * Daryl Lau (@Daryllautk)</code></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> * Klim K (@milkyklim)</code></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> * Sunil Srivatsa (@alphastorm)</code></p>

<h2 id="dip-editor-responsibilities">DIP Editor Responsibilities</h2>

<p>For each new DIP that comes in, an editor does the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Read the DIP to check if it is ready: sound and complete. The ideas must make technical sense, even if they don’t seem likely to get to final status.</li>
  <li>The title should accurately describe the content.</li>
  <li>Check the DIP for language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure, etc.), markup (Github flavored Markdown), code style</li>
</ul>

<p>If the DIP isn’t ready, the editor will send it back to the author for revision, with specific instructions.</p>

<p>Once the DIP is ready for the repository, the DIP editor will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Assign an DIP number (generally the PR number or, if preferred by the author, the Issue # if there was discussion in the Issues section of this repository about this DIP)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Merge the corresponding pull request</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Send a message back to the DIP author with the next step.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The DIP editors monitor DIP changes, and correct any structure, grammar, spelling, or markup mistakes we see.</p>

<p>The editors don’t pass judgment on DIPs. We merely do the administrative &amp; editorial part.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The DIP document was derived heavily from the SIP Synthetix Improvement Proposal document in many places text was simply copied and modified. Any comments about the DIP document should be directed to the DIP editors.</p>
