<p>
  Your first PR should be a first draft of the final DIP. It must meet the
  formatting criteria enforced by the build (largely, correct metadata in the
  header). An editor will manually review the first PR for a new DIP and assign
  it a number before merging it. Make sure you include a
  <code>discussions-to</code> header with the URL to a discussion forum or open
  GitHub issue where people can discuss the DIP as a whole.
</p>
<p>
  If your DIP requires images, the image files should be included in a
  subdirectory of the `assets` folder for that DIP as follow:
  <code>assets/dip-X</code> (for dip <b>X</b>). When linking to an image in the
  DIP, use relative links such as <code>../assets/dip-X/image.png</code>.
</p>
<p>
  When you believe your DIP is mature and ready to progress past the WIP phase,
  you should ask to have your issue added to the next governance call where it
  can be discussed for inclusion in a future platform upgrade. If the community
  agrees to include it, the DIP editors will update the state of your DIP to
  <code>Approved</code>.
</p>
